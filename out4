Title: Advanced C%Science Programming Techniques
Description: This is a course about the practice of programming.
   Programming is more than just writing code.  Programmers must also
   assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test,
   improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves &
   others. At the same time, they must be concerned with compatibility,
   robustness, and reliability, while meeting specifications.  Students
   will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their
   own code and in group projects.
Prerequisites: COS 217 and COS 226.

Title: General Computer Science
Description: An introduction to computer science in the context of
   scientific, engineering, and commercial applications. The goal of the
   course is to teach basic principles and practical issues, while at
   the same time preparing students to use computers effectively for
   applications in computer science, physics, biology, chemistry,
   engineering, and other disciplines. Topics include: hardware and
   software systems; programming in Java; algorithms and data
   structures; fundamental principles of computation; and scientific
   computing, including simulation, optimization, and data analysis. Two
   lectures, two precepts.

Title: Topics in the Intellectual History of Modern and Contemporary
   Spain: Culture and Memory of the Spanish Civil War
Description: An examination of the narrative, poetry, film, songs,
   photography and graphic art generated by Spaniards and foreigners
   about the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) in the seventy years since
   the war was fought. This cultural production will be examined in the
   context of the political and ideological reasons that explain the
   international attraction the war generated. Among the works examined:
   poems by Neruda; Picasso's Guernica (it was the first war in which
   aviation played a significant role); documentaries (The Spanish
   Earth, Mourir a Madrid); and photographs by Robert Capa (the Spanish
   Civil War consecrated the nascent art of photojournalism).
Prerequisites: At least one SPA 200-level course (two 200-level SPA
   courses advisable) or instructor's permission.

Title: Policy Seminars
Description: In policy seminars students work in groups first
   formulating the general problem, then engaging in individual research
   on subtopics, and finally presenting their inferences for discussion
   and debate and producing a collective policy report.
Prerequisites: Enrollment is limited to WWS concentrators and
   certificate students. The course is required for concentrators, for
   whom it is considered Junior Independent Work.  Junior concentrators
   are automatically signed up for the policy seminar as Junior
   Independent Work, not as WWS 402.  WWS juniors who are certificate
   students must enroll.  Seniors serving as commissioners and graduate
   students serving as consultants may enroll with permission of the
   instructor.

Title: Energy for a Greenhouse-Constrained World
Description: This course addresses, in technical detail, the challenge
   of changing the future global energy system to accommodate
   environmental constraints. Energy production strategies are
   emphasized, including renewable energy, solar, wind, nuclear fission
   and fusion, the capture and storage of fossil-fuel carbon, and energy
   storage strategies.  Efficient energy use is also considered, as well
   as intersections of energy with economic development, international
   security, local environmental quality, and human behavior and values.
Prerequisites: Freshman physics requirement.  In addition, it is
   suggested that students have some coursework in thermodynamics or its
   equivalent but not required.  Students from all departments of the
   University are welcome and are permitted in the course.

Title: Studies in German Film: Early German Cinema
Description: This seminar in media history, theory and criticism
   subjects a rediscovered cache of rare silent films to a variety of
   critical interrogations, exploring the complex intermedial dynamics
   (relations to theater, variety, literature), establishment of key
   legitimation discourses (film criticism and theory, the Autorenfilm),
   development of new narrative forms ("birth" of the feature film, the
   serial detective genre), work of ignored pioneers (the Brothers
   Skladanowsky, Oskar Messter), gender and class dynamics in the
   transformation of the public sphere, and issues of technology,
   politics and the historicity of perception.
