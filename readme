Akuei Johnson Ateny Akuei's Contribution:
At the start of the assignment, my teammate and I discussed our overall approach, breaking down the tasks to ensure an
efficient workflow. I took primary responsibility for designing and implementing the database module, focusing on
structuring the database schema and integrating it with our Python application using SQLite. Once the module was
complete, I provided a detailed explanation to my teammate, ensuring a mutual understanding of its functionality. We
then worked together to debug any issues that arose, refining the queries and optimizing performance. Additionally,
I contributed to testing and refining our implementation of regdetails.py, helping to ensure that it met the assignment
requirements.

Percy Amoani's Contribution:
After gaining an understanding of the database module, my teammate, Percy Amoani, took the lead in implementing
regoverviews.py, which involved retrieving and structuring relevant data from the database for user-friendly output. He
explained his approach to me, and together we worked through debugging sessions to refine the logic and ensure seamless
integration with the database. For the final component, regdetails.py, we collaborated closely, coding side by side to
complete the implementation efficiently. Afterward, we worked together to review and edit the test programs, ensuring our
solution was well-tested and met all specified requirements.

While working on the assignment, we adhered to the course policies regarding external help. We did not receive direct
assistance from other students or outside individuals. However, we made use of the official course materials, including
lecture notes and discussion board posts, to clarify certain concepts and address implementation challenges.

We spent about 10 hrs working on it.

We learned so much from the assignment, especially how to integrate SQLite into Python.
